Welcome to the Happy Xmas Commit Simulator! 🎅🎄 This program is designed to take your Git activity graphs to the next level, turning your commits into digital Christmas art. Want to draw a message or pattern with your contributions? This program does it for you while you enjoy a cup of hot chocolate! ☕

## What does this program do?

✨ Automates your commits: Generates commits on specific dates to simulate constant activity in your repository.

✨ Creates custom graphs: If you choose the right dates, you can draw patterns on the GitHub activity graph (e.g., "HAPPY XMAS").

✨ Does all the heavy lifting: Manages the repository, synchronizes it with GitHub, and resolves any conflicts so you don’t have to worry.

## How does it work?

The program:

1. Goes through a list of magical dates 🎅 (that you define).
2. Makes commits on those dates with automatic messages.
3. Pushes the commits to GitHub.
4. Updates your contribution graph to display amazing patterns.

## Create Your Own Magic! 🪄

### 1️⃣ Create your project

First, create a repository on GitHub. Make sure it is public if you want everyone to admire your masterpiece.

### 2️⃣ Clone this program

Clone this magical project and navigate into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/jccamel/happy_xmas_2025.git
cd happy_xmas_2025
```

### 3️⃣ Set up your magical variables

Edit the file `commits_actividad.py` and customize the following variables:

- `GIT_USER_NAME`: Your GitHub username.
- `GIT_USER_EMAIL`: Your associated email address.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Create a Personal Access Token in GitHub with write permissions to the repository.

### 4️⃣ Run the program

Execute the script and sit back while the program works for you:
```
python3 commits_actividad.py
```

### 5️⃣ Check your masterpiece

Once completed, go to your activity graph on GitHub and watch your art come to life. 😍

## What can you draw?

### 💡 Some creative ideas:

Messages like "HAPPY XMAS" or "2025".
Simple drawings like hearts ❤️, stars ⭐, or Christmas trees 🎄.
Anything you can imagine... The possibilities are endless!

## Caution! ⚠️

- Be kind with your commits: Don’t abuse this tool to spam.
- Stay safe: Make sure to use a secure Personal Access Token and don’t share it publicly.
- Be careful with forced pushes: The program will try to resolve conflicts, but always review your repository before overwriting changes.
